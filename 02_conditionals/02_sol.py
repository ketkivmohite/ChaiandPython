# 2. Movie Ticket Pricing 
# Problem : Movie tickets are priced based on age :
# $12 for adults(18 and over), $8 for children. Everyone gets a $2 discount on Wednesday  

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
day = input("Enter the day ")

price = 12 if age >= 18 else 8 

if day == "Wednesday" :
    # price = price - 2 
    price -= 2 

print("Ticket price for you is $", price)
